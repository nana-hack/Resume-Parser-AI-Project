# Resume-Parser-AI-Project
The Resume Parser project aims to build a resume parser using the spaCy library in Python. The parser will extract relevant information from a resume, such as personal details, work experience, education, and skills.  The project uses the spaCy library for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.
